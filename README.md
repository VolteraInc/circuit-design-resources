Gerbers and other useful things for circuit designers.

For EAGLE users, use voltera_EAGLE_community_lib.lbr to access the part files for the templates and substrates.

For other CAD tools, dimensioned drawings and raw gerbers are available.

Feel like contributing to the Voltera community? We'd appreciate your help in creating template parts libraries for other CAD tools. If you create a library, let us know and we'll link to your work!
